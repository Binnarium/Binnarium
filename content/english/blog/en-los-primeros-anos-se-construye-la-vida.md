At present, with the advancement of science, it has been determined that the first six years of a child's life are of vital importance for their future development. Timely intervention through early stimulation opens a series of opportunities that favor the development of the infant in the social, cognitive, affective and motor fields; According to the WHO (2005),: “60% of children under six years of age are not stimulated, which can condition a delay in any of its three spheres” (p.2). In this way, the importance of adequate, timely, continuous and differentiated stimulation is highlighted.

Stimulation is a process that allows the child to create a series of neuronal connections called synapses, which give rise to functional structures in the brain that form a very important basis for learning. Its application begins from the first years of the infant's life; through simple exercises or games that the caregiver can use according to the age of the child. In this way, during early childhood, as UNICEF (2011) mentions: "the stimuli presented in this period are essential to develop their senses, movements, thinking and learning." (p.3). Thus benefiting their development, a condition that will directly affect the foundation of their conditions for learning.

Early stimulation should address the development: senso-perceptual, cognitive, affective, motor, socio-moral, as well as the formation of habits and behavior. These contents must be established according to each stage of development. Taking as the main basis, the determinants of development and the guidelines that constitute what is expected in each period. It requires, in addition to the professional who provides the stimulation in a specialized center, the actions of the child's parents to be stimulated to achieve the maximum performance of the infant's potential.

The importance of early stimulation in an individual's life is indisputable, it provides the tools and fundamental bases in the emergence of their cognitive functions. Said benefit is not limited exclusively to the individual, in the long term the benefits of applying correct stimulation affect social, political and economic aspects, thus translating its collective impact. It is the responsibility of all professionals who carry out their activities with children during their first years of life to provide conditions and spaces that guarantee the full development of their brain plasticity, in order to reduce or mitigate possible complications in the educational field, especially in the acquisition of processes of: reading, writing and calculation.
